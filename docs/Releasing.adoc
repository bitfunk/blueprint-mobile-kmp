== Release Preparation

Create a release branches of from `main` branch with following pattern:

* `release/{major}.{minor}/prepare-{major}.{minor}.{patch}`

Add following changes:

* Update CHANGELOG.adoc by creating a new Unreleased section and change current unreleased to release version
* Update README.adoc `project-version` to release version
* Update the latest release badge link:../assets/images/badges.adoc[HowTo]

Releases are automatically created when a tag in the form of `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` is added.
