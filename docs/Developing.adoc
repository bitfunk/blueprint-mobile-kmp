=== Features

Every change has to branch of from `main` and use this branch naming convention:

* `feature/{type_of_change}-{short_description}` or with ticket id `feature/{ticket_id}/{type_of_change}-{short_description}`

`main` must be always in releasable state.

==== Type Of Change

- *add* for new features or functionality
- *change* for changes in existing features or functionality
- *remove* for removed features or functionality
- *fix* for any bug fixes
- *bump* for dependency updates
- *security* in case of vulnerabilities

Examples:

- `feature/SDK-456/add-awesome-hashing-algorithm`
- `feature/add-awesome-hashing-algorithm`
- `feature/remove-not-so-awesome-algorithm`
- `feature/fix-algorithm-corner-case`
- `feature/bump-lib-to-1.3.0`
